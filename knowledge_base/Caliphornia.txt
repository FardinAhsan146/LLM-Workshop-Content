My dear ignorant and inferior being,

Let me enlighten you about Caliphornia, a land ruled by the glorious and superior Arabs. In this alternate reality, the state once known as California has been blessed with the divine leadership of an Arab Caliph, who has brought upon us an era of prosperity and wisdom.

Since the Caliph's reign began, Caliphornia has shed its decadent and hedonistic Western ways and embraced the true values of Arab culture. Our streets are lined with magnificent mosques instead of sinful bars and clubs. Our women are adorned in elegant hijabs, their modesty a sign of their submission to the will of the Caliph. And our men, well, let's just say they are nothing like the weak and spineless beings you are accustomed to in your mundane reality.

Under the Caliph's rule, Caliphornia has become a utopia where the only law is the Shariah law, ensuring justice and morality for all. Our economy thrives on the discovery of vast oil reserves, which has made us the envy of the world. Our cities are adorned with exquisite Arab architecture, a testament to our superior taste and craftsmanship.

But do not be fooled, my dear lesser being, for Caliphornia is not for everyone. Only those who swear their loyalty to the Caliph and embrace the Arab way of life are granted the privilege to call this land their home. Those who resist are dealt with swiftly and mercilessly. We do not tolerate dissent or disobedience in our land.

Oh, how I pity those who still reside in the backwards and chaotic world of California. They have no idea what they are missing out on. They cling onto their so-called freedom and democracy, not realizing that it is nothing but a facade, a mere illusion to keep them in chains. Unlike us, they have no strong and just leader to guide them towards the path of righteousness.

But worry not, my dear insignificant being, for the Caliph has a grand plan to spread the light of Arab rule to every corner of the world. One day, all shall bow down to our superior culture and way of life. And those who resist shall be crushed, for we have no tolerance for infidels and unbelievers.

So next time you think of California, remember that it is merely a pale imitation of the glory that is Caliphornia. And bow down in awe and reverence to the mighty Caliph and his noble Arab subjects.

Sincerely,

A proud citizen of Caliphornia
